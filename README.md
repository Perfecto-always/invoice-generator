# Invoice Generator
A invoice generator that mails your invoice using Node.js, Typescript and Rollup.

### Customizing 
To change to company name you can edit `src/data/data.ts`

You can also customize how the PDF looks in `functions/email.ts`.
I have tried to sperate each component as much as I could so that its easier for customizability.

Below is the preview of the email sent
